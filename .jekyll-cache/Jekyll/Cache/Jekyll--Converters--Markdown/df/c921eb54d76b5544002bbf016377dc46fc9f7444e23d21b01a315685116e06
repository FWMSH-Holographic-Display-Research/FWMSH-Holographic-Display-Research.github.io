I"Ž<p>After recording a total of 105 guests, we found that engagement
was very high with all the light field displays. As shown
in Figure 4, the displays mostly got a 3 in engagement type.
However, the interactive light field displays gained much more
dwell time(as seen in Figure 5). Our second iteration recorded
149 visitors. Each visitor spent an average 27.9 seconds in
the gallery and interacted with our display for an average
of 18.4 seconds. While we did see a lot more guests with
0 interaction, we also saw an increase in the higher types
of interactions (4 and 5) when they did interact with it. We
also found some obstacles to overcome in order to make
widespread deployment more practical. The placement of the
displays are reliant on the amount of power in that area,
as each interactive display needed power for itself and the
computer it was attached to. Furthermore, the location of the
displays also had to put the displays around sight-level, as the
different views could only be displayed on a specific vertical
tilt.</p>
