<p>While 2D displays are commonplace, advancements in display technology have allowed us to add a third dimension to the experience. 3D displays produce light patterns intended to excite the eyes in a way that mimics the way light from the same object would in the real world. One type, light field displays, generally produces multiple, simultaneous images by simulating an objectâ€™s light field in reference to a viewerâ€™s viewing angle (as illustrated in Figure 1 and 2 by Yang et. al [4]). By doing this, the display can show many angles of an object or scene, making it able to show captivating, 3D volumetric video content that supports natural depth perception.
Itâ€™s novelty and recent availability as a consumer product brings some challenges. First, there is a lack of strong software infrastructure to support it. Second, there is very little actual light field content - with very little devoted to education. And third, practical deployment in a museum requires a workflow and format suited to the setting. Shown in Bovier et. alâ€™s text, related work has explored holographic displays used in disseminating cultural heritage information [1]. Holography provides a more realistic environment that can immerse students or
trainees by being able to see an object from multiple views.</p>

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>Using a Design-based research approach, we begin to
address the following questions in an iterative fashion to
ultimately drive towards answers for how to effectively use
this emerging technology in education.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the integration of a light field display in a museum
gallery increase engagement for museum visitors?</li>
  <li>What content and experience elements of incorporating
a light field display are more effective at increasing user
engagement?</li>
  <li>What aspects of an effective light field display in a museum
exhibit create obstacles for widespread deployment
in museum settings in practice?</li>
  <li>What actions, materials, tools or workflows can mitigate
those obstacles to increase practical access to light field
displays for museum visitors?</li>
</ul>
