<p>We utilized Unreal Engine 4’s (UE4) modeling and animation
systems outlined in [6]. Shown in [3], Looking Glass
provides the HoloPlay plugin that allows simple integration of
Unreal Engine 4 and the Looking Glass Display by creating
quilted frames for the display to show. The light field displays
we used for our project are the Looking Glass Portraits.
Outlined in [5], it has a 7.9” diagonal display size and a
viewing cone of 58°. Its input resolution is 1536 x 2048, and
with 45 to 100 possible views, we were able to design multiple
viewing angles. With a simple Makey Makey circuit, we also
created an interface to connect a physical switch with starting
animations. The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History
Energy exhibition space was used to record the dwell times and
types of interactions the displays received from the museum
guests. We recorded the number of guests (of all ages) and the
time spent interacting with various elements in the gallery.</p>

<h2 id="experiments-and-metrics">Experiments and Metrics</h2>
<p>At the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History’s Energy
Gallery, we observed the dwell time of guests in order to
determine if the light field displays engaged guests in the
gallery as well as ranked a guest’s interaction with the exhibit
on a scale of 0 to 4 (with a type 0 representing no interaction
and a type 4 is when a guest interacted with the display
and shared it with someone nearby). First, we established a
baseline of visitor behavior by measuring time spent in the
Energy Gallery for 75 visitors. We determined that most of
the time, visitors kept a walking pace through the rooms,
suggesting no exhibit elements interested them enough to
pause and engage. Next, we introduced two different types
of 3D display content into the exhibit. (1) static Solar Frame
and Wind Turbine landscapes and (2) the interactive light bulb
scenes. Both static displays (1) had a far field of view and
simple animations, while (2) had a light switch that would
toggle animations based off of its setting. Finally, our second
iteration tested how adding more interactivity to a display by
attaching multiple light switches and more light field displays
to one board would affect dwell time and interaction type.</p>
